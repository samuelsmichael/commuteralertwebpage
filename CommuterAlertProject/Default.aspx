        Thank you for your interest in <span class="product-emphasis">Commuter Alarm</span>.
        We hope that this product becomes a part of your ever-expanding repetoire of personal
        <i>Smart Phone</i> productivity apps. It was certainly conceived of

        What's at stake?
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
        Has this ever happened to you?<br />
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
        The day's been hard. Much harder than you thought that it was going to be. That
        morning you planned on exactly which commuter train you had to take so that you
        would have plenty of time to arrive at your daughter's recital. And my, how hard you worked
        in order to make sure that you could get to that train on time!
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
        You board your train (or bus), and relax in the <i>very</i> comfortable chair ... satisfied that you have succeeded, 
        despite all the odds against you! You even
        have some time to read a few articles in the newspaper!
    </p>    
    <p class="main-body">
        All of the sudden, you sit up with a start!  You feel a little disoriented.  You take a few moments to
        study your surroundings.  You've been sleeping.  "Oh no! I've slept through my stop!  
        There's no way that I'll be able to make it in time!"  
        How many more recitals is your daughter going to have?  Perhaps your not being there makes her lose her confidence!  
        Maybe it will affect all her future possibilities.
    </p>
    
    <p class="titular-medium" style="margin-top: 2em;">
        The Solution
    </p>
    <p class="main-body">
        Let's be truthful with ourselves.  No matter how much care we take ... no matter how hard we try ... nevertheless,
        a moment will come when the world presses us so hard, that we <i>will</i> sleep through your stop.

    <p class="main-body">
        A responsible and realistic person - when given the opportunity - will insure him or herself against this possibility.
        What is insurance, anyway?  It's paying a very small amount ahead of time as an assurance that an unanticipated (and perhaps, disasterous) event doesn't happen.
        What if the train or bus company offered this possibility?  What if, for a small additional fee, you could pay an agent to come make sure that
        you didn't miss your stop?  You've already paid 2, 3, maybe even 5 dollars for a ticket.  What would this be worth to you?
   </p>
    <p class="main-body">
        Commuter Alarm provides the closest thing to this this assurance.   For a dime -- or even less --
        you can rest assured ... Commuter Alarm won't let you sleep through your stop!
